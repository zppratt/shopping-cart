# Vue.js Shopping Cart Test Project

Thanks for your interest in working at Sweetwater! We're always excited to meet awesome people. We've created this test to help us understand your programming chops.

## What you'll build

We'd like you to build a Shopping Cart application using Vue.js, Vuex, and ES6. We've provided a JSON file with item data, but you're responsible for building the Cart. Your shopping cart should:

- display the list of items in the cart along with their relevant information;
- allow item quantities to be changed;
- display the subtotal for all the items in the cart.

## How you'll build it

- You can use any VCS platform you like — such as Gitlab or Github — as long as your project is publicly accessible.
- Build your shopping cart so we can test it in-browser.
- Write your application using Vue.js.
- Manage your data using a Vuex data store.
- Use the data provided in [items.json](items.json) to populate the cart. Don't make any changes to the data.
- It's OK to use a CSS framework (like Bootstrap). This isn't a CSS test. It doesn't have to be pretty.
- Don't use any other JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery.
- Once you're done, send us the link to your project so we can look it over.

## Requirements

- __Commit often.__ We want to see your progress throughout the project.
- __Work quickly.__ We will be looking at how far you get in the first hour as well as how long it takes you to arrive at a finished product. This project was designed to be completed quickly, so don't spend more than a few hours on it.
- __Write your own code.__ While we understand that there are NPM pakages out there that take care of common problems, we ultimately want to see what _YOU_ can build, not what someone else has built.
- __Do your best work.__ We're using this project as a viewport into who you are as a developer. Show us what you can do!

## Bonus points

- +10 points for making the data changes persistent. No... we're not going to give you any hints about how we want to see that done.
- +10 points if you include the functionality to remove items from the cart.
